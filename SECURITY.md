- The config file is stored in `~/.immich-memories/config.yaml`

### Network Security

- All communication with Immich should be over HTTPS
- Verify your Immich server's SSL certificate is valid

### Local Storage

- Downloaded videos are cached locally
- Cache directory: `~/.immich-memories/cache/`
- Clear cache periodically if disk space is a concern
